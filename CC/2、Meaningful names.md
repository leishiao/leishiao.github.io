## 2„ÄÅMeaningful names

We name and name and name. Because we do so much of it, we'd better do it well.

**Use Intention-revealing Names**

Choosing good names takes time but it saves more than it take. 
So take care of your names and change them when you find better ones. 
Name should tell you why it exist, what it does and how it is used. 
If a name requires comment, if does not reveal its intent.

**Avoid Disinformation**

We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. 
Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`.
Beware of using names which vary from in small ways.
Spelling similar concepts similarly is *information*. Using inconsistent spelling is *disinformation.*

**Make Meaningful Distinctions**

If name must be different, then they should mean something different.
Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) is the opposite if intentional naming, they are noninformative.
Noise words are another meaningless distinction. *Info* and *Data* are indistinct noise words like *a*, an, and *the*.

**Use Pronounceable Names**

A significant part of our brains is dedicated to the concept of words.
If you can't pronounce it, you can't discuss it without sound like a idiot.
This matters because programing is a social activity.

**Use Searchable Names**

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.
In this regard, longer names trump short names, searchable name trumps a constant in code.
Single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods.
