## 2„ÄÅMeaningful names

We name and name and name. Because we do so much of it, we'd better do it well.

**Use Intention-revealing Names**

Choosing good names takes time but it saves more than it take. 
So take care of your names and change them when you find better ones. 
Name should tell you why it exist, what it does and how it is used. 
If a name requires comment, if does not reveal its intent.

**Avoid Disinformation**

We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. 
Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`.
Beware of using names which vary from in small ways.
Spelling similar concepts similarly is *information*. Using inconsistent spelling is *disinformation.*
